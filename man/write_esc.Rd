\title{Write one or more 'esc' objects into an Excel csv-file}
\usage{
write_esc(..., path, sep = ",")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more objects of class \code{esc}}

\item{path}{Path to write to, or just file name (to write to working directory).}

\item{sep}{The field separator string. In some Western European locales, Excel
uses a semicolon by default, while in other locales the field
separator string in Excel is a comma.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined data frame that is written to
        the csv-file (see \code{\link{combine_esc}}).
}
\description{
This method is a small wrapper to write csv-files. It writes
             the results from \code{\link{combine_esc}} into an Excel csv-file.
}
\note{
For Western European locales, the \code{sep}-argument probably needs to
      be set to semicolon (\code{sep = ";"}), so Excel reads the csv-file properly.
      If \code{sep = ";"}, \code{\link[utils]{write.csv2}} is used to write the
      file. Else, \code{\link[utils]{write.csv}} is used.
