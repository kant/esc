\title{Effect Size Computation for Meta Analysis}
\description{
  This is an R implementation of the web-based 'Practical Meta-Analysis Effect Size Calculator' from David B. Wilson. \cr \cr
  Based on the input, the effect size can be returned as standardized mean difference (\code{d}),
  Hedges' \code{g}, correlation coefficient effect size \code{r} or Fisher's transformation \code{z},
  odds ratio or log odds effect size.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Return values} \cr \cr
  The return value of all functions has the same structure:
  \itemize{
    \item The effect size, whether being \code{d}, \code{g}, \code{r}, (Cox) odds ratios or (Cox) logits, is always named \code{es}.
    \item The standard error of the effect size, \code{se}.
    \item The variance of the effect size, \code{var}.
    \item The lower and upper confidence limits \code{ci.lo} and \code{ci.hi}.
    \item The weight factor, based on the inverse-variance, \code{w}.
    \item The total sample size \code{totaln}.
    \item The effect size measure, \code{measure}, which is typically specified via the \code{es.type}-argument.
    \item Information on the effect-size conversion, \code{info}.
    \item A string with the study name, if the \code{study}-argument was specified in function calls.

  }
  \strong{Correlation Effect Size} \cr \cr
  If the correlation effect size \code{r} is computed, the transformed Fisher's z and their confidence
  intervals are also returned. The variance and standard error for the correlation effect size r are always
  based on Fisher's transformation.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Odds Ratio Effect Size} \cr \cr
  For odds ratios, the variance and standard error are always returned on the log-scale!
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Preparing an Effect Size Data Frame for Meta-Analysis} \cr \cr
  The results of the effect size calculation functions in this package are returned as list with
  a \code{esc}-class attribute. The \code{\link{combine_esc}}-function takes one or more
  of these \code{esc}-objects and combines them into a \code{data.frame} that can be
  used as argument for further use, for instance with the \code{\link[metafor]{rma}}-function.
